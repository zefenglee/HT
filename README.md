Title: Transcriptomic Profiling and Machine Learning Reveal Novel RNA Signatures for Enhanced Molecular Characterization of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis

Abstract
Background Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), an autoimmune disease with increasing prevalence, presents challenges for early detection due to subtle clinical symptoms in Early Hashimoto's thyroiditis (EHT) cases. This study aimed to utilize whole-transcriptome sequencing data to identify characteristic biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment targets in EHT.
Methods Peripheral blood RNA-seq data from 61 individuals (31 EHT patients and 30 controls) were used. Differential expression analysis and Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) model were integrated to identify EHT-associated characteristic biomarkers. The biological basis of these biomarkers was explored through co-expression network analysis and the construction of regulatory networks based on experimental non-coding RNA interactome (ENCI). A novel Stacking model was constructed to enhance the reliability and stability of risk characterization. 
Results 79 EHT characteristic biomarkers (3 mRNA, 6 miRNA, 64 lncRNA, and 6 circRNA) were identified. Co-expression networks (77 nodes, 266 edges) and regulatory networks (18 nodes, 45 edges) provided insights into regulatory mechanisms. Enrichment analysis highlights that the immune system, cell adhesion and migration, RNA and protein regulation are involved in HT pathogenesis and are dysregulated early in the disease. Our stacking model achieved 95% accuracy and 97% AUC, showcasing the potential for early HT diagnosis using the identified biomarkers and machine learning (ML) models. 
Conclusions This comprehensive study contributed valuable insights into the complex molecular landscape of EHT. The integration of clinical, molecular, and computational approaches presents a holistic understanding of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, paving the way for advancements in early diagnosis and targeted interventions.
